# Weather App 

Building Our App: Tools of the Trade
To build our weather app, we'll be using three key tools:

# HTML:
 This is the blueprint of our app, like the foundation of a house. It defines the structure and content layout. Imagine using building blocks like walls and windows to create the basic shape of our app.
# CSS:
 This is the interior decorator! CSS lets us style our app, choosing fonts, colors, and layouts to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Think of it as painting the walls, adding furniture, and making the app look snazzy.
# JavaScript:
 This is where the magic happens! JavaScript adds interactivity to our app. It will allow us to fetch weather data from the API and dynamically update the information displayed on the screen. Imagine it as the electrical wiring that brings everything to life, letting us control lights, switches, and weather updates
